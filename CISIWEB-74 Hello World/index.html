<h2> A little bit about myself: </h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Johnathan. I am 25 years old and am currently working part time while going to school full time. After high school<br> I worked a few jobs here and there before deciding it was time for me to further my education and so here I am! I am currently taking<br> courses in computer science while also exploring a field in Fire/EMS as an alternative route for a career. <br>Personally, I am a bit of a home-body and mainly enjoy playing video games/ watching shows & movies or spending time with family<br> in my spare time but do also occasionally enjoy going out to a restaurant or the movies.</p>
